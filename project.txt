For our project:

------------We are able to
1. build a board and its cell is used to point vehicles
2. move vehicles according to the rule
3. update board and vehicles List after move.
4. build UI by FXML
5. grab input from UI.   which is the object we built in UI, the object contain
 its id and x, y coordinate.
6. Use the x, y to check with the Board data.


------Data structure:
Data for Board.  ---- class board
viewer Mycontroller ---- class Mycontroller
which is a has-a relationship

Mycontroller has a board data.


----------we have the problem:
1.we need to generate vehicles from back stage,
and send it to FXML, then draw this vehicles out.
since we are now draw vehicles and generate vehicles by manually

2.when we start the game, generate a board in UI need to relate with the board
  data. we didn't do that, we initialize Board UI and board data manually.

3.I recommend we dont do a has-a relationship for controller and board data,
    MVC will be good. but I have no idea how to build this design structure yet.
